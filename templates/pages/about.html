    <p class="lead"> <h2>Usage</h2>
    From the "Just Eat It" Home page, click to continue, and then select the allergy profile
    of interest and then click the button. The Eat Map is a heat map showing the suitability
    for a person with the allergy profile selected. It is measured by the "allergy index" determined
    by the proportion of recipes of that type of cuisine that are suitable (i.e. do not contain the ingredient(s)
    in the allergy profile. For example a measure of 100% would indicate that none of the recipes for that
    country / cuisine contain any of the allergens in the users' profile. Whereas a score of 0% would indicate
    that all recipes for that country / cuisine contain one or more of the food allergens in the selected profile.

    Just Eat It is my capstone project developed as part of
    <a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html" target="_blank">The Data Incubator Fellowship</a>
    Fall 2017 cohort in San Francisco.

    <p class="lead"><h2>Motivation</h2></p>

    While travelling, here or overseas, food provides a window into other cultures and peoples.
    The simple act of sharing a meal can assist understanding and acceptance.

    However, if like my son you have a complex food allergy, fully participating in the travelling experience
    and finding suitable foods can be difficult and sometimes life-threatening!

    Food allergies have the following characteristics:
    <ul>
        <li>Effect many people in many ways</li>
        <li>Are increasingly prevalent</li>
        <li>Can have a serious health and social impacts</li>
        <li>Are socially isolating</li>
        <li>Are a significant remedial cost to society</li>
    </ul>

    Thus I have developed the "Just Eat It" app which allows users to register** and specify their allergy profile,
    combined with recipe data from Yummly to produce TripAdvisor-like personalised
    cuisine recommendations.

    ** An added benefit of the app is to create a crowd-sourced allergy database for research purposes.

    The information provided in the "Just Eat It" app is general in nature. Persons with food allergies should
    make their own inquiries before eating any food to determine if it is appropriate for their individual circumstance.
